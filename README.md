# sudoku

compile sudoku3.c,sudokuurtility.c, sudokugen.c, sudoku.h,sudokusolve.c together. (maybe correct function call in sudoku3.c
)
compile sudoku3.c,sudokuurtility.c, sudokugen.c, sudoku.h,sudokusolverecursive.c together. Will run too but with suboptimal result
because solver will always find same solution (2nd solution may be not found this way).
